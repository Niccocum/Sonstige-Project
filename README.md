# Sonstige-Project - Marketing Analytics Bootcamp Final Project

Welcome to our Marketing Analytics Bootcamp final project!

## Overview

This project serves as the culmination of our Marketing Analytics Bootcamp. Our task was to create a website using the fundamentals of web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and then integrate various technologies learned during the bootcamp to track user behaviour, conversions, interactions and of course gathering data.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Used to build the website's frontend.
- Hotjar: Integrated for website heatmap and session recordings.
- Google Tag Manager (GTM): Implemented for managing and deploying marketing tags on the website and track conversions.
- Google Analytics: Utilized for tracking website traffic and user interactions.
- BigQuery: Employed for querying datasets via SQL.
- Google Sheets: Utilized for data storage and analysis.
- LookerStudio: Utilized for visualizing and showcasing data insights.

## Project Details

We chose to create a website for a fictional satirical political party, developed by us, which required an online presence to support its political endeavors. The primary objective of the website was to drive newsletter subscriptions, serving as the macrogoal for the project. Additionally, we aimed to analyze the data gathered from newsletter subscriptions to gain insights into the average user/voter.

## Folder Structure

- /css: Contains CSS files for styling the website.
- /js: Contains JavaScript files for website interactivity.
- /img: Contains image files used on the website.
- /data: Contains datasets used for analysis.
- /pdf. Presentation
